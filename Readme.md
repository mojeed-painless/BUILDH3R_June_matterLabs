# Build smart contract

This learning journey provided a comprehensive foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. 

By completing practical tasks and documenting progress on GitHub, I gained hands-on experience and built a demonstrative portfolio. 

I mastered creating ERC20 tokens, managing hashed messages on the blockchain, and automating contract interactions using ethers.js. 

Additionally, I explored using zkSync and paymasters to handle transaction fees and manage token balances.
